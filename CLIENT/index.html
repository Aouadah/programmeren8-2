        Welcome!

        Do you think you know everything when it comes to games? Think again!
        <br>
        This is a quiz where you can test your knowledge about games. First, tell the chatbot which game you 
        want to get a quiz about. The chatbot will then ask you questions about that game. After 5 questions, 
        the chatbot will tell you how many questions you answered correctly.
